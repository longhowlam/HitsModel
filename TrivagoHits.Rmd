# Introduction

This R Markdown document presents the result of the Trivago Hits model.

## Background
The data is in .csv format containing information of about nine hundred thousand sessions.  The columns should be understood as follows:

* row_num: a number uniquely identifying each row.
* locale: the platform of the session.
* day_of_week: Mon-Fri, the day of the week of the session.
* hour_of_day: 00-23, the hour of the day of the session.
* agent_id: the device used for the session.
* entry_page: describes the landing page of the session.
* path_id_set: shows all the locations that were visited during the session.
* traffic_type: indicates the channel the user cane through eg. search engine, email, ...
* session_duration: the duration in seconds of the session.
* hits: the number of interactions with the trivago page during the session.


## Task
Note that the column “hits” has missing values. Use the data provided to build a model that predicts the number of hits per session, depending on the given parameters. Refer to the deliverables section to check how to hand in your solution.



## Evaluation
Your predictions will be evaluated by the root mean square error. 

$$ error  = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} ( predictedHits_i - oservedHits_i)^2}{N}}$$
